# Pair-Game
I created a simple matching-pair game using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) based on a tutorial on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Tutorial can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/projects/python-game)

Here is a snippet of the final product, during playing time.
